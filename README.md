# DCODE : A Blockchain based Competitive Coding Platform

## IDEA :

To build a Blockchain based platform for online coding competitions registering coders through ethers, which uses a special ranking algorithm like "elo algorithm" to rank the coders and updates their ethers according to their performance in the competition.

## Demystifying Rewarded Coding Competitions :

- Easy to organize
- Unaltered Ranking System
- Blockchain based System for Rewarding
